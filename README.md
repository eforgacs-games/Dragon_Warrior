ABOUT
=====

This is a clone of Dragon Warrior for the Nintendo Entertainment System, done in Python.


REQUIREMENTS
============

[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/), [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news), [PyGame Menu](https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Run it from the command line using the interpreter. If you are in the 
DragonWarrior directory, type:
python src/game.py

Run on Repl.it
============

For quick demonstration purposes, you can run this in the browser on repl.it, but ideally this should be run normally through the command line as delineated above, since performance suffers greatly in the browser.
